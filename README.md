# ECE-Lab-Equipment-Automation
Making this repository in case anyone needs to do a lot of measurements on campus lab equipment and wants to be able to controll the equipment via laptop/pc. 

Currently only confirmed it works with **USB** connections, will extend functionallity to Ethernet/LAN in the future as well.

To use, would recommend having a virtual environment but all you need is any version of **Python** that is compatible with **PyVISA** (Python 3.6+) and PyVISA (Whatever the latest one is).
